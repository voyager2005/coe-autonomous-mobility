# Contributing to the CoE Repo

To maintain high standards and ensure "who wrote what" is always clear, all members must follow these guidelines.

## 1. Branching Strategy
* **NEVER** push directly to `main`.
* Create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-project-name`.
* Use descriptive branch names that include the project or your name.

## 2. Commit Message Standards
Commit messages tell the story of the project. Please follow this format:
* `feat:` A new feature or research script.
* `fix:` A bug fix.
* `docs:` Documentation changes only.
* `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.

**Example:** `feat: added some xyz logic to some abc script`

## 3. Pull Request (PR) Workflow
1. Push your branch to GitHub.
2. Open a Pull Request.
3. **Tag a Reviewer:** Assign your project lead or the Group Head for review.
4. **The "Successor" Rule:** Ensure your code is commented. If another student has to take over your project in 6 months, could they understand it?

## 4. Documentation Requirements
* Every new folder **must** have a `README.md` based on the provided template in `/templates`.
* Include comments for complex mathematical formulas or logic.

## 5. Deletions and Archiving
If a project is no longer needed, **do not delete the folder**. Instead, move it to an `archived/` directory or mark it as "Archived" in the project's README. This preserves the academic history of the Center.
